# DataMining-Project


## Project Description

Our project focuses on exploring and understanding university students’ anxiety.  
It highlights the problem of student anxiety and its potential impact on academic performance,  
and applies data analysis to uncover meaningful patterns in the dataset.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to analyze students’ academic and demographic factors to predict and understand their levels of anxiety. Using data mining techniques, the project will:

1. **Classification:** Categorize students into anxiety levels (Minimal, Moderate, Severe).  
2. **Clustering:** Group students with similar anxiety patterns and academic characteristics to uncover common risk factors.

Beyond analysis, this project aims to shed light on the psychological challenges students face, helping to create a more supportive educational environment that reduces anxiety and promotes student well-being.


## Data Set Source

This project utilizes anxiety data from university students, which were part of a broader study examining anxiety, stress, and depression. In this project, the focus is specifically on anxiety.
