## Project Description

Our project focuses on exploring and understanding university students’ anxiety.  
It highlights the problem of student anxiety and its potential impact on academic performance,  
and applies data analysis to uncover meaningful patterns in the dataset.
The dataset allows us to apply both classification and clustering methods to analyze anxiety levels and related patterns.

## Project Motivation

University students today face unprecedented levels of psychological pressure due to academic workloads, social expectations, and financial stress. Anxiety, in particular, has become one of the most critical mental health challenges, often going unnoticed until it severely impacts performance and well-being. We chose this topic because identifying anxiety at an early stage can empower universities to provide timely support, reduce dropout risks, and promote healthier learning environments. By leveraging real student data and applying modern data science techniques, our project aims to transform raw survey responses into actionable insights that can help educators, counselors, and policy makers build a more supportive academic community.
